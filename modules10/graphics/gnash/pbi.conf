PBI_DESC="Gnash is a GNU Flash movie player. Previously, it was only possible to play flash movies with proprietary software. While there are some other free flash players, none support anything beyond SWF v4. Gnash is based on GameSWF, and supports many SWF v7 features. - Runs standalone Gnash can run standalone to play flash movies. - Browser plugin Gnash can also run as a plugin from within most Mozilla derived browsers, such as Firefox. Gnash also has support for Konqueror. - SWF v7+ compliant Gnash can play many current flash movies. - Streaming Video Gnash supports the viewing of streaming video from popular video sharing sites like Lulu.tv or YouTube.com. - XML Message server Gnash also supports an XML based message system as documented in the Flash Format specification. - High Quality Output Gnash uses OpenGL for rendering the graphics on the desktop, and AntiGrain (AGG) for embedded framebuffer only devices. - Free Software Gnash is 100% free software. For more information on the GPL, go to the Free Software Foundation web site. - Better Security Gnash pays extra attention to all network connections, and allows the user to control access. - Extensible Gnash supports extending ActionScript by creating your own. You can write wrappers for any development library, and import them into the player."
