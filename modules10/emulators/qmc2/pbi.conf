PBI_DESC="M.A.M.E./M.E.S.S. Catalog / Launcher II - also referred to as QMC2 - is the successor of one of the first UNIX MAME GUI front ends available on this planet called QMamecat (derived from MAMECAT, which was text-only). QMamecat was based upon Qt 2 its development was frozen in 2003. QMC2 has been rebuilt from scratch as a Qt 4 project. Parts of the design and code were inspired by its predecessor, but it\'s not just a remake. We tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to minimize dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator configuration scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional command line options (defined in an XML template file). As a result of this flexible design, QMC2 can be used for multiple emulators. Currently we support SDLMAME & SDLMESS on UNIX and Mac, and the original variants of MAME & MESS on Windows."
