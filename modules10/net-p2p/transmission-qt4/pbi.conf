PBI_DESC="A fast and lightweight QT4 BitTorrent client, loosely based on the GTK+ client. This is the only Transmission client that can act as its own self-contained session (as the GTK+ and Mac clients do), and can also connect to a remote session (as the web client and transmission-remote terminal client do). Transmission has been built from the ground up to be a lightweight, yet powerful BitTorrent client. Its simple, intuitive interface is designed to integrate tightly with whatever computing environment you choose to use. Transmission strikes a balance between providing useful functionality without feature bloat. Furthermore, it is free for anyone to use or modify."
