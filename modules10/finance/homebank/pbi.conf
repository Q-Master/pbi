PBI_DESC="HomeBank is the free software you have always wanted to manage your personal accounts at home. The main concept is to be light, simple and very easy to use. It brings you many features that allow you to analyze your finances in a detailed way instantly and dynamically with powerful report tools based on filtering and graphical charts. Furthermore, HomeBank benefits from more than 10 years of users\' experiences and feedback as its development started in 1995 on Amiga computers. It is now available on Amiga, GNU/Linux, and will probably be available soon for Microsoft Windows and MacOS X systems as GTK+ exists on them."
