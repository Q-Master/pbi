PBI_DESC="This is a SILC network client Q: What is SILC? A: SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides secure conferencing services in the Internet over insecure channel. SILC is IRC like although internally they are very different. Biggest similarity between SILC and IRC is that they both provide conferencing services and that SILC has almost same commands as IRC. Other than that they are nothing alike. Biggest differences are that SILC is secure what IRC is not in any way. The network model is also entirely different compared to IRC."
