PBI_DESC="The Freedroid RPG is an extension/modification of the classical Freedroid engine into an RPG. The main differences to the classical version are as follows: <br>* The Tux is the main character of the rpg. <br>* The game uses isometric viewpoint and animated pre-rendered 3d character models for all characters inside the game. <br>* Dialogs and chatting with friendly droids and humans: Multiple-choice menus and voice samples (with subtitles for those without sound). <br>* There is an item and inventory system that is modeled after some popular standards of the industry :) <br>* An automap feature was added. (this is currently a bit unmaintained since part of the code needs to be re-written for proper OpenGL support in the automap display) <br>* Saving and loading of games. <br>* Shops to trade things and skills to learn. <br>* Controls are different: Mouse is the input method of choice. <br>* This is a graphically intense game. Therefore the archive size is comparably *huge* and not suitable for modem downloads with a dialup connection. "
