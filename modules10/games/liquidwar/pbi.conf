PBI_DESC="Liquid War is a unique multiplayer wargame. Its rules are truely original and have been invented by Thomas Colcombet. You control an army of liquid and have to try and eat your opponents. A single player mode is available, but the game is definitely designed to be multiplayer, and has network support. When playing Liquid War, one has to eat one\'s opponent. There can be from 2 to 6 players. There are no weapons, the only thing you have to do is to move a cursor in a 2-D battlefield. This cursor is followed by your army, which is composed by a great many little fighters. Fighters are represented by small colored squares. All the fighters who have the same color belong to the same team. One very often controls several thousands fighters at the same time. And when fighters from different teams meet, they eat each other, it is as simple as that. Note: If the game crashes this might resolve it: Inside liquidwar, go to options->rules->advanced and change Algorithm from "Assembly" to "Standard C" See also the "ASM" option in the port build options."
