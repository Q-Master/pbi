PBI_DESC="The target of the game is to reach the target door of each of the 8 towers in currently 2 missions with this little green animal. This door is usually at the very top of the tower. But finding the way by using elevators and walking trough a maze of doors and platforms is not the only problem you have to solve. There is a bunch of other creatures living on the tower that will hinder you to reach your target by pushing you over the edge of the platforms. The only weapon of defence you have is to throw a little snowball. But most of the other creatures just don\'t care about this. So you must avoid them."
