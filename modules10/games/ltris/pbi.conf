PBI_DESC="LTris is just another clone of Tetris but IMHO a good one, so if you like Tetris, download and play it! Features: Tetris clone using SDL Sound Menu Controls can be redefined Block preview Starting level between 0 and 9 Various backgrounds HighScores Nice graphics Smooth gameplay Cool effects (transparency, animations) Two player mode Two game modes Two game modes? Yes. The "normal" mode is the one everbody knows well. You play as long as you can while the blocks are getting faster. The second one called "advanced" has some additional features. First there is a new figure in each new level and second later on there are suddenly appearing tiles and rows."
