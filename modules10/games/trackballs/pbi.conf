PBI_DESC="Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness on the Amiga in the 80\'s. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out. It should be noted that this game is not intended to be a replica of marble madness but rather inspired by it. For instance the game uses advanced 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use for it. Also we aim at making the game highly configurable by a scripting extension (Guile) and provide a simple editor by which new levels easily can be created. If you wish to cheat or simply are testing out a level you are currently designing you can give the command \'trackballs -l foo\' which jumps to level "foo"."
