PBI_DESC="Legacy was originally written as a fork of DOSDoom introducing mouse-look, jumping, a console, 32 player deathmatch, skins and a native win32 mode. Fabrice developed a Glide front-end, one of the first hardware-accelerated renderers. Hurdler was originally introduced to develop GL support, however as time went by, Hurdler increasingly maintained the project. Pate took on the task of creating a new OpenGL renderer, as Hurdler had less time to contribute to the project after pursuing a career in professional game development. Fabrice has now moved on to pastures new, with Boris making an occasional appearance."
