PBI_DESC="Legends is a fast-paced first-person-perspective online multiplayer game released as freeware (software license). The game is designed to take advantage of the beautiful environments available from the Torque engine it is based on, while still offering the breakneck pacing and variety of styles available from such classics as Quake and Tribes. Gameplay is not the strafe-strafe-jump-strafe-shoot-strafe-run-like-hell style a lot of games espouse the addition of a jetpack adds a third dimension of mobility that makes skill, forethought, and restraint necessities to winning. Team sizes are ideal between 10 and 15 on each side, and the network code allows 56k upwards to play smoothly. Game type offerings range from the classic Capture the Flag, Deathmatch and Duel to our own new types, e.g.. \'War\'. Plenty of maps are provided by us, but the beauty of this game is its customization possibilities. Mission creation has never been easier, with a stable, full-featured editor integrated into the game engine itself. Skins, models, and effects can all be modified by the end-user with commonly available tools. The game has an Autodownload feature which means you never have to leave the game to join new user created Client-Side and Server-Side missions."
