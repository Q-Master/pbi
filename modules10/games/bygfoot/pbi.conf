PBI_DESC="Bygfoot is a football (a.k.a. soccer) management game for PC-BSD and other UNIX look-alikes. It is an original concept by Gyz Both and has been improved with suggestions by players from all over the world. After Gyz abandoned the project, Mark Lawrenz took over and is currently developing and maintaining Bygfoot. Bygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and selling them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be promoted or relegated, even become a champion if you\'re a skillful manager. The game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep one eye at your players and another at your stadium."
