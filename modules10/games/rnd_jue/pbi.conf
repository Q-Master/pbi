PBI_DESC=""R\'n\'D jue" is an alternative version of Rocks\'n\'Diamonds, developed incooperation with R&D author Holger Schemel.In contrast to the "rnd_jue -contribution package"(still available on Download page) it is a separate and independent programwith the same source code as the original R\'n\'D but with acompletely different appearance.This is based on the wide customizing features which have been developedrecently while all the integrated games have been produced with the R\'n\'DLevel Editor, which is actually a great "game creation tool" fornon-programmers. So far "R\'n\'D jue" is also an example for what is possiblewith the old Rocks\'n\'Diamonds and should be an inspiration for potentiallevel designers and game developers.Regarding the games and levels "R\'n\'D jue" is intended for players who have bothan eye for an attractive design and a bent especially for "puzzle games".The user will also find "action" and many opportunities to test hismanual-skill - nevertheless, the main feature of "R\'n\'D jue" is primarilyto offer some (moderate) challenges for the brain."
