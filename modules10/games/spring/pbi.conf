PBI_DESC="Spring is a project aiming to create a new and versatile RTS Engine. It features: <br>* Large battles limited only by the power of your computer support for up to 5000 units. <br>* Large, highly detailed maps in which to wage those battles, fully 3D with deformable terrain, forest fires, dynamic and reflective water, and custom skyboxes. <br>* Several camera modes, allowing for anything to be viewed from almost any angle. <br>* Fully 3D combat in land, sea, and air, with realistic weapon trajectories (physics engine). <br>* Many different Games, made just for Spring. <br>* Complex 3rd party AIs (Bots) that can work very competently in many cases with multiple Spring engine games and mods. <br>* A powerful GUI designed to minimize unnecessary micromanagement that is easily extensible via a Lua API. <br>* Frequent engine additions and bugfixes. REMEMBER: Spring its an ENGINE. You can play this games following their own easy instructions in order to play: <a href="http://spring.clan-sy.com/wiki/Games">Spring Games Wiki</a>"
