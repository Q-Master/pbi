PBI_DESC="nPush is a logic game similar to Sokoban and Boulder Dash. You need to collect all the gold on the level and reach the exit. To make it hard there are some rocks that stand in your way, and you also have some dynamite to blast them away. Main difference from Sokoban, KSokoban and similar games is that you can have multiple player-controlled characters you can move on the screen. nPush is written in C++. The source code is freely available under GPL license, version 2 or above. The code is very simple, so if you\'re interested in working on your C++ skills on a simple project, please feel free to join in."
