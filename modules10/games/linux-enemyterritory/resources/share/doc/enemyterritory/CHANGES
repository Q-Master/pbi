catching and disabling in_dgamouse (thanks zinx!)

- ET 2.56. New setups, incremental and full.
  Fixed text mode setup on glibc 2.3 systems (RH9 typically)

24/06/2003 - TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>

- server side patch 1: fix server crash
- pbweb.x86 is included in the setup:

to make sure you are running the latest pb version, do as root:
# cd /usr/local/games/enemy-territory/pb
# ./pbweb.x86
and also remove the local ~/.etwolf/pb/ directory

alternatively, you can copy pbweb.x86 to ~/.etwolf/pb/ and run it in that directory.

- Build 2.44.1

Fixed uppercase F being interpreted as a backspace in Linux dedicated console

04/30/2003 - TTimo <ttimo@idsoftware.com>

com_watchdog and com_watchdog_cmd cvars:

If a dedicated server is idle (because there is no map loaded, or the running server was killed or died),
com_watchdog_cmd command will be executed after com_watchdog seconds of waiting.

Default value for com_watchdog is 60. Set to 0 to disable.
There is no default com_watchdog_cmd command. If the cvar is empty, the server will quit so that
cron scripts can detect server dying.
