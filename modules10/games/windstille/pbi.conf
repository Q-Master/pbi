PBI_DESC="In Windstille the player will be placed in a foreign alien world and has to find its way back into safety. Special focus will be on getting the foreign world and the players character itself believable. Exploration will be more needed than plain shoot action, even so the players-character will be equipped with a multifunctional war-suit, so he will be far from defenseless. The game will have slow placed explore and seak sequences as well as more rough section that will feature fast shoot and jump action. The game world should be presented in a consistent state, enemies once destroyed should not respawn automatically. The player is free to go forward and backward in the world as long as the level design allows it."
