PBI_DESC="The bulk of the game play involves finding power-ups and hidden areas and avoiding or squashing strange alien monsters bent on your destruction. There are a few hidden areas, and in several locations, the player will experience different levels based upon which path is chosen. There are no lives or continues in the game. If the player dies, he/she simply restarts at the beginning of the level. All creatures and power-ups are persistent in each level, in other words, if all but one enemy has been killed on a level when the player dies, there will only be that remaining creature as the player restarts."
