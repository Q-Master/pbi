PBI_DESC="Pike is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language.It looks a bit like C and C++, but it is much easier to learn and use.It can be used for small scripts as well as for large programs.Pike is :- High-level and powerful, which means that even very complex things are easy to do.- Object-oriented, which means that you can use modern programming techniques to divide a large program into small pieces, which are much easier to write than it would be to write the entire program at once. - Interpreted, which means that you don\'t have to wait for a program to compile and link when you want to run it.- One of the fastest "scripting" languages available.- Garbage-collected, which makes programming much simpler, and removes the risk for memory leaks and other memory-related bugs.- Easy to extend, which means that you can create plug-ins, written in Pike as well as in C or C++, and integrate them with the rest of Pike."
