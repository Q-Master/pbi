PBI_DESC="Freevo is an open-source digital video jukebox (PVR, DVR) based on Linux in addition to a number of open-source audio/video tools. MPlayer is used to play audio and video files. MPlayer is an excellent media player that can play most popular file formats. Freevo can be used both for a standalone PVR computer with a TV+remote, as well as on a regular desktop computer using the monitor and keyboard. Freevo is easy to download and install for new users. Most hardware is supported (graphic boards, sound cards and video capture devices). The Freevo core is under heavy development. It is mostly written in the Python programming language which is very well suited for high-level control applications like Freevo."
