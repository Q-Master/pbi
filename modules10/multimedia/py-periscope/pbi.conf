PBI_DESC="periscope is a subtitles searching module written in python that tries to find a correct match for a given video file. The goal behind periscope is that it will only return only correct subtitles so that you can simply relax and enjoy your video without having to double-check that the subtitles match your video before watching it. This is done by using as much info as available from your file and on the websites. Some websites allow you to use hash of the files, the size/length of the video or the exact file name. As a python module, periscope should be easily integrated in many projects that allow plugins to be written in python. The fact that the plugin is shared between all the applications means that separate application and their plugin (file browser, video player, media center application, ...) don\'t have to maintain the code to search, parse and download subtitles and the user preference about languages. The subtitles websites are handled as plugins."
