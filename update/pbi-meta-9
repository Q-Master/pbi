The application is built on top of the Paranoia library, which is doing the real work (the Paranoia source is included in the cdparanoia source distribution). Cdparanoia reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC, or raw 16 bit linear PCM.  Cdparanoia is a bit different than most other CDDA extraction tools.  It contains few-to-no \'extra\' features, concentrating only on the ripping process and knowing as much as possible about the hardware performing it. Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio data from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, frame jitter, and loss of streaming during atomic reads.  Cdparanoia will also read and repair data from CDs that have been damaged in some way.  Cdparanoia is easy to use and administrate.  It has no compile time configuration, happily autodetecting the CDROM, its type, its interface and other aspects of the ripping process at runtime.

Once you do, those blocks disappear, and put off slightly your inevitable demise.  To add to the excitement, chunks of red garbage will fall from above. It is impossible to eliminate this garbage directly. However, if you eliminate any blocks which are touching the garbage, the garbage will shatter into normal, run-of-the-mill blocks.  Throughout the game your stack of blocks will slowly grow from below, initially quite slowly but always faster and faster. When the stack reaches the top it will pause and you have seven seconds to save yourself. It is possible, however, to get a momentary repose from your stack\'s assent. When you eliminate a block or cause garbage to shatter, the growth of your stack will pause. Even if your stack has reached the top and you\'re about to lose, you will be given a little more time to save yourself.

App=Darktable;Graphics;http://images.pbidir.com/progicons/darktable.png;The Darktable Team;http://www.darktable.org/;GPL;Graphical;graphics,picture,editing,photo;Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable.  It also enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.  This project tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free raw converters and image management tools (such as UFRaw or F-Spot).  The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all stored in a database.  The user will always be able to interact, even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.  All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image buffers for display.  The full image is only converted during export.  The frontend is written in Gtk+/Cairo, the database uses SQLite3, raw image loading is done using libraw and rawspeed, high-dynamic range and standard image formats such as JPEG are also supported.  The core operates completely on floating point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).;;

The main differences to the classical version are as  follows:   <br>* The Tux is the main character of the rpg. <br>* The game uses isometric viewpoint and animated pre-rendered 3d character    models for all characters inside the game. <br>* Dialogs and chatting with friendly droids and humans:   Multiple-choice menus and voice samples (with subtitles for those   without sound).  <br>* There is an item and inventory system that is modeled after some    popular standards of the industry :) <br>* An automap feature was added. (this is currently a bit unmaintained   since part of the code needs to be re-written for proper OpenGL   support in the automap display) <br>* Saving and loading of games. <br>* Shops to trade things and skills to learn. <br>* Controls are different:  Mouse is the input method of choice. <br>* This is a graphically intense game.  Therefore the archive size is   comparably *huge* and not suitable for modem downloads with a dialup   connection.  ;;

App=Gwenview-kde4;Graphics;http://images.pbidir.com/progicons/gwenview.png;Aurlien Gteau ;http://gwenview.sourceforge.net;GPL;Graphical;image,viewer,editor;Gwenview is an image viewer for KDE.  IMAGE VIEWING Gwenview can load and save all image formats supported by KDE. It correctly displays images with alpha channel, using the traditionnal checker board as a background to reveal transparency. Gwenview lets you accurately control the way images are scaled: you can zoom in and out or automatically scale the image to fit the window. Zoom is locked so that you can easily compare images by going back and forth. When browsing JPEG images with EXIF information, Gwenview automatically rotates them according to the EXIF orientation tag. It can show image properties and image specific meta-information like Dolphin does. It knows about animated images like MNG or GIF and is also capable of displaying vector images in SVG format as well as playing videos.  IMAGE MANIPULATIONS Gwenview does not try to replace your favorite image editor, so it only features simple image manipulations: rotation, mirroring, cropping, resizing and red eye reduction. When working with JPEG files, Gwenview performs lossless manipulations.  BROWSING YOUR COLLECTIONS OF IMAGES Gwenview features the necessary file management operations: copy, move, delete, rename and drag \'n\' drop images. It has full support for KIO slaves: you can browse FTP/Windows shares, go into tarballs or zip files.  PRESENTING YOUR IMAGES The fullscreen with optional thumbnail bar and the simple built-in slide show allows you to present images the way you want them to show.  THE INTERFACE Gwenview features a browse mode to get a quick overview of images in a folder and a view mode to go through one image at a time. The view mode can also display a thumbnail bar.  KPARTS Gwenview can be used both as a standalone application and embedded in other KDE applications through the KPart system. For example, thanks to Gwenview image KPart, Konqueror can display images using Gwneview, letting you zoom in and out as well as rotate it.;;

During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents\' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.  A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player\'s or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).;;

So, uh, there\'s a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.  In order to trap the penguins, you\'ll need to break the iceberg into small chunks. (They\'re afraid of water, for no apparent reason.) You do this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.  If a penguin hits a line in progress, however, it vanishes with a loud noise, and you lose a life. (Yes, a life. This story is really breaking down, isn\'t it? But never fear -- I\'ll keep going until it\'s completely dead.)  Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than that, you\'ll save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek Cred (a.k.a. "score").  After you ship off one batch of penguins, it\'s time to move on to the next. Each subsequent \'berg will have one more penguin, and you\'ll have one more life. This will continue until you lose, or until you exceed level one hundred or so, which Ain\'t Gonna Happen.;;

Two to four players try to steer penguins from the safety of the central igloo to the player\'s water hole.

Arrows can be chosen using the control cursor in the lower part of the screen, and be placed on any free field using the field cursor and the action key. Each arrow will disappear after after a given time (15 seconds by default) and a new arrow will automagically appear in the control field.  Bears eat penguins (at least in this game). If a bear enter a player\'s target area, the player loses up to 15 points (the score can not become negative) Special penguins, marked by a colored ring, score 10 points and launch a 10 second long special event. See below for a list of events.  The game ends when the ice on the right side of the screen has reached the bottom (after 3 minutes by default)  Winner is the player who gathered the most penguins.;;

QMamecat was based upon Qt 2 its development was frozen in 2003. QMC2 has been rebuilt from scratch as a Qt 4 project. Parts of the design and code were inspired by its predecessor, but it\'s not just a remake. We tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to minimize dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator configuration scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional command line options (defined in an XML template file).  As a result of this flexible design, QMC2 can be used for multiple emulators. Currently we support SDLMAME & SDLMESS on UNIX and Mac, and the original variants of MAME & MESS on Windows.;;

App=SDL_Jewels;Games;http://images.pbidir.com/progicons/sdljewels.png;Dave Ashley;http://www.linuxmotors.com/gljewel/;GPL;Graphical;game,arcade,bejeweled;The game is very simple. There is an 8x8 array of jewels of 7 types. You need to get 3 or more in a row horizontally or vertically in order to score points. You can swap any two jewels that are next to each other up and down or left and right. The mechanic is to click the mouse on the first one, then drag in the direction to switch with. Then let up on the mouse button, but this last isn\'t so critical.  Jewels can only be swapped if after the swap there is at least one 3 or more in a row set created. Otherwise the jewels return to their original position.  There is a clock shown on the left. When it counts down to 0 the game is over. You will probably be able to enter your name into the high score table. Hit enter when done.  Hit F1 or spacebar to start a new game, or ESC to exit.  This game makes use of OpenGL. Without an OpenGL implementation it won\'t work. If you only have software rendering you can still play but the frame rate will be lower. The GLX module must be present as well.;;

App=Vamps;Multimedia;http://images.pbidir.com/progicons/vamps.png;Vamps Team;http://vamps.sourceforge.net/;GPL;Text;dvd,backup,shrink;The idea was to use the high performance Metakine M2Requantiser to create a transcoder for Linux for shrinking the content of a DVD9. This would enable backups on cheap single layer DVDRs (double layer burners weren\'t even available that time).  Vamps builds a wrapper around the requantizer to extract the elementary MPEG2 video stream from the DVD\'s program stream, feed it through the requantizer and finally re-pack it into the program stream again. Besides this, Vamps allows the selection of both audio and subtitle streams that should be copied into the output stream. This gives another small gain of disk space, since unwanted streams may be discarded.  Summed up, Vamps is only a very basic, but nevertheless essential tool to transcode DVD videos to a smaller size. Vamps does not need to write temporary data files, which is a major pro. Vamps is very fast. The downside is, that Vamps is not capable of making DVD backups on its own.;;

App=rdiff-backup;System Utilities;http://images.pbidir.com/progicons/rdiff-backup.png;rdiff-backup Team;http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/;GPL;Text;backup,utility;rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as root), and modification times. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted.;;

Games;http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/;GPL;Graphical;game,strategy,RTS;0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or rewrite the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built game engine.  The game has been in development by Wildfire Games (WFG), a group of volunteer, hobbyist game developers, since 2001. The code and data are available under the GPL license, and the art, sound and documentation are available under CC-BY-SA. In short, we consider 0 A.D. an educational celebration of game development and ancient history.;;
